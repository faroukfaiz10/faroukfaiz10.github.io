description: "This project is a simple script to add codeforces upcoming contests to your Google calendar. Useful for cross referencing with your own schedule to quickly check when you can participate in an event.

However, this was not needed as Codeforces offer the possibility to <a href='https://codeforces.com/calendar'>export</a> contests' calendar. This was either a new feature, or missed from my part when starting the project.
