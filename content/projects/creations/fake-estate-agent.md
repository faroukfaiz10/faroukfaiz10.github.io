description: "The project is a bot that checks for housing in Crous and Arpej residences which are known to be the hardest to get in France, especially in Paris. 
<br/>
The bot notifies with a Discord message whenever new availibilities show up. And for the Crous, which is more challenging to get as housing disappears as soon as it shows up, the bot can book the accomodation automatically.
