Final year computer science and engineering student at Eurecom and IMT Atlantique. Open source enthusiast and part time freelancer.

I'm a software engineer by day, but I'm passionate about a lot of related fields: web, devops, data science and engineering, cybersecurity and distributed systems to name a few.
