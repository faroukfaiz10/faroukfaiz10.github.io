Final year computer science and engineering student at Eurecom and IMT Atlantique. Open source enthusiast and part time freelancer.

I'm a Software engineer by day, but I'm passionate about a lot of related fields: Web, Devops, Data science and engineering, Cybersecurity and distributed systems to name a few.
